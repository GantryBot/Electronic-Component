#Buying Guide

* Buy Bipolar motor. I never use unpolar configuration anyways.
* Buy motor <= 2 Amps. Driver cost shoots up for > 2 Amp motor.
* Buy Bholenath driver. They seem to be nice. Or buy from ebay.
* Upload the datasheet. Its get very difficult to look for specs later on.
* write rating by permanent marker.
